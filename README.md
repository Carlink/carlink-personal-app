# Carlos Castro Projects

My name is Carlos, I am a Software Developer from Mexico City and I really love technology, playing video games, reading, traveling, but above all learning every day.

I have a technical degree in Electronics and a Bachelor in Telecommunications, so I am a lover of mathematics and manual projects.

I have been working for the last 6 years as a frontend in a wide variety of companies and projects and I can only say that I love being a developer, I never get bored of solving challenges, designing algorithms and having the opportunity to work with new people.

I am passionate about challenging projects, especially those related to fintech and telecommunications.
